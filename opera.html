    ACT II<br>
    <h5>
        Same Scene. Night. Awning removed. Moonlight. CAPTAIN
        discovered singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a
        mandolin. LITTLE BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at
        him.
    </h5>
    <h6 class="SON">SONG—CAPTAIN</h6>
    <p class="song">

        Fair moon, to thee I sing,
          Bright regent of the heavens,
        Say, why is everything
          Either at sixes or at sevens?
        I have lived hitherto
          Free from breath of slander,
        Beloved by all my crew—
          A really popular commander.
        But now my kindly crew rebel,
          My daughter to a tar is partial,
        Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell,
        He threatens a court martial!
          Fair moon, to thee I sing,
        Bright regent of the heavens,
          Say, why is everything
        Either at sixes or at sevens?
    </p>
<h6 class="but">BUT.</h6>
<p class="song">
            How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the
            unconscious moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It may
            be! Who is poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall
            on one so lowly! And yet if he knew—if he only knew!
</p>
<h6 class="cap">CAP.</h6>
<p class="direction">(coming down).</p> 
 <p class="speech">! 
            Little Buttercup, still on board?
            That is not quite right, little one. It would have been more respectable
            to have gone on shore at dusk. BUT, True, dear Captain—but the recollection of your sad
            pale face seemed to chain me to the ship. I would fain see you smile before I go.
</p>
<h6 class="sir">SIR.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> 
            Corcoran, I am much disappointed with your
            daughter. In fact, I don't think she will do.

<h6 class="jos">JOS.</h6>

            then your lordship is of opinion that married
            happiness is not inconsistent with discrepancy in rank?

            Let the air with joy be laden,
            Rend with songs the air above,
            For the union of a maiden
            With the man who owns her love!
        </p>

  <h6 class="dic">DIC.</h6>          
        <p class="speech">    
            Kind Captain, I've important information,
            Sing hey, the kind commander that you are,
            About a certain intimate relation,
            Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.

            Now, hark at that, do!
            Though foes we could thump any,
            We are scarcely fit company
            For a lady like you!
