    ACT II<br>
    <h5>Same Scene. Night. Awning removed. Moonlight. CAPTAIN
        discovered
             singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a
        mandolin. LITTLE
             BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at
        him.</h5>
<h6 class="but">BUT.</h6>
<p class="speech">How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the
  unconscious
  moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It may
  be! Who is
  poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall
  on one so
  lowly! And yet if he knew—if he only knew!
</p>
  CAPT. (coming down). Ah! Little Buttercup, still on board?
  That is
  not quite right, little one. It would have been more respectable
  to have
  gone on shore at dusk.
  BUT, True, dear Captain—but the recollection of your sad
  pale
  face seemed to chain me to the ship. I would fain see you smile
  before I
  go.

  SIR JOSEPH. Captain Corcoran, I am much disappointed with your
  daughter. In fact, I don't think she will do.

  JOS. Oh! then your lordship is of opinion that married
  happiness is not
  inconsistent with discrepancy in rank?

  ALL.          Let the air with joy be laden,
                Rend with songs the air above,
                For the union of a maiden
                With the man who owns her love!

  DICK.         Kind Captain, I've important information,
                Sing hey, the kind commander that you are,
                About a certain intimate relation,
                Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.

  CREW.         Now, hark at that, do!
                Though foes we could thump any,
                We are scarcely fit company
                For a lady like you!
